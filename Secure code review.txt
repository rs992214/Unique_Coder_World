Manual Approch
Build your code in any IDE.
Search for regex pattern manually
For XSS search <%== This is used to print in the response and check user input directly printed in response without validation.

For SQL search sql, execute query, query and check user input directly going in sql query and there is no parametarised query used.

search for SSRF .openconnection and check user input is used to to make server to server call.

For os command injection check user input being used runtime execution

Secure Coding Guidelines:
Here are 22 tips to write safer applications. These improve the security of your application and provide you with
multiple layers of defense.
1.Validate all inputs at the server
2.Prefer white lists to black lists
3.Escape special characters
4.Use prepared statements in database queries
5.Use strong, random session tokens
6.Use a hidden token in transaction requests
7.Never store secrets in hidden fields/cookies
8.Use cache-control directives to prevent sensitive data being cached
9.Set session cookie to HTTPOnly
10.Set the path attribute for cookies
11.Set autocomplete=off
12.Use HTTP redirection during login
13.Invalidate sessions on logout
14.Forcefully log out the user when suspicious events occur
15.Log failures in the audit log
16.Do not hard code the database password
17.Use standard crypto algorithms and libraries
18.Use SSL for transmission of all sensitive data
19.Store passwords as salted hashes
20.Use try...catch...finally to handle exceptions
21.Define and use custom error pages
22.Train your developers in secure coding

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manual Secure Code Anlysis:
1.Before intiating the testing we should know the type
of application whether it is java,aspx,php,SQL etc

2.Secondly we should known the know the purpose of the application
like payment, billing, form , maker-checker so that we can look for 
logical functionality.

3. The Application owner or the developer will provide 
you all the source code prequiste including the 
web.config file, . 

4. The web.config file is the configuration file of the
application where all basic settings of servers are 
associated with like Headers implementation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Findings to Look in web.config file are: 
1. Password In Configuration File - Press Ctrl +F and search for uid/pwd:
2. ErrorHandling.RevealsDetails.Message - Press Ctrl +F and search for customerrors
 (If custom error are off then error page will reveal sensitive information)
3. DEBUG enabled - Press Ctrl +F and search for debug="true"
4. Older version of Application Framework used -  Press Ctrl +F and search for targetFramework
  (If Target Framework is 4.0 or less than that is older version, Target framework is 
  basically the .Net Framework version and its version depends upon the application)
5. Server Banner like Asp version, X-Asp version and server version - Press Ctrl +F and search for 
   X-Powered By, Server:. X-Asp
6. Web Server HTTP Dangerous Method Detection: In web.config file search for Acess-Allow-Control-Methods.
7. HTML5 cross-origin resource sharing: In web.config file search for Access-Control-Allow-Origin



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Use of Hardcoded Cryptographic Key: Press Ctrl +F and search for encryptionkey/encryption_key throughout all source code

2. The application is vulnerable to a URL redirection flaw : Press Ctrl +F and search for Response.Eedirect
  (if the query is Response.Redirect(Raw.URL); then it is possible for open redirection)

3. Potential File Upload: Press Ctrl +F and search for FileUpload throughout all source code
  (In some cases the type of file upload like aspx, png, jpeg, php is specified)

4. Using known vulnerable components: If the application source code has any vulnerable version of jquery, bootstarp or anyother

5. Developer Comments: Look for some senstive data throught the application code like database password, 
                    default credentials

6. Password is encoded/encrypted using weak algorithm: Press Ctrl +F and search for String password (for java)
     If the application is using the MD5 algorithm then it is weak

7. Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG: Search for random rand in the Rndstring.java

8. Application uses default FTP Anonymous Login: Press Ctrl +F and search for anonymousAuthentication
      (In the source code it will be like anonymousAuthentication enabled="true")

9. Improper Exception Handling : Example is like system.out.println("Exception :")

10. An adversary can trick the user into visiting a fake site via a Response-Splitting: look for response.setheader in source code

11. Use of Hardcoded Credentials : In the datbase source code file like Dbacess.java search for user/password or databaseName or userid/pwd
SDE

12. An adversary can get access to sensitive details in logs : Search for logger.lof throughout the source code.

13. Print Stack Trace used in application source Code: Search for PrintStackTrace/StackTrace throughtout the source code of Appn:

14. Obsolete files are present in the application: Miscellenous include files, backup, unused or obsolete files exist 
                                                   as indicated. If these files contain program source, information such 
												   as server logic or ODBC/JDBC user ID and passwords may be revealed since
												   these file extension may not be processed by the web server.

15. Password In Configuration File: Search for username/password throughout the source code.

16. The application prints sensitive information in application console. For java based application the finding wll be like:
                System.out.println("" + userid + pwd);

17. Weak Cryptography/Password is encrypted/encoded using weak algorithm : Look whether the application supports
                                                                          weak algorithms like md5 , search for md5 in the source code

18. The application has a weak password policy: Search for password/pwd ex: pwd: "123456"

19. Default Credentials

20. Session cookie attributes are not set properly:  Search for the attributes like secure, domain, path in main.java or main.php

21. LDAP Injection attack might be possible on the application : Search for ldap throughout the source code and check if username 
                                                                and password is in the same query

22. Application Test Script Detected: The application is still using old files like web.old.config or err.text 

23. Insecure String Object : Search for string username in the source code . Here the string query like username or password 
                             is not encrypted but in simple format
24. Unreleased Resource							 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Mobile Applications:
The Android Manifest xml,yml and other source code files will be provided:
1.Application has set insecure permissions

Secure Code Analysis:
Secure code review is the process of auditing the source code for
an application to verify that the proper security controls are 
present, that they works as intended, and that they have been
invoked in all the right places.

SCA is a set of softwares security analyzers that search for violations 
of security- specific coding rules and guidilines in a variety of 
languages.

SAST- Static Application Testing 
DAST- Dynmaic Application Testing
SCA- Static Code Analyzer
Vulnerability - Defect or a security flaw in the system that 
can be exploited for malicious intentions
Exploits: Exploitation of the vulnerability by piece of code 
referred as exploits

Myths - Secure Code Review
Static code analysis has nothing to do with develeoper
developer background, just a basic knowledge of code/lofic 
will workout. Nowadays static code tools are user friendly 
that it gives t details about flaw with the code flow.

As a code reviewer you are expected to point out possible 
flaws/vulnerabilities that creates loopholes in the 
application.


Open Source Tools 
1. Find Bugs - For Java
2. Sonarqube - IDE Integration
3. Roslyn Security Guard - best for Dot net

Audit WorkBench:
It is A GUI based component use for FPR analysis,
FPR stands for Fortify Project Report, the audit workbench 
is mainly used for scanning and to find out the false positive
in the source code.

BIRT (Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools)
It is an open souce technology platform by thr Eclipse 
foundation which is basically used to generate the scan 
reports.

Custom Rules Editor:
It is used to filter out or to apply some rules to the scan
project.

Scan wizard is a command line utility which is used to
invoke your scans by command and also has a GUI. It basically
shows file level categorization then generates a bat/sh file
for scanning.

SCA state is used to monitor your scans and also to schedule 
your scan. It also shows the errors generated during the scans
